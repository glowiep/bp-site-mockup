## Design Concept 💫
The mockup features a clean and minimalist design with a focus on user-friendly navigation, intuitive layout, and engaging visual elements.

## Process 💭
- The goals for this redesign were simple. Due to time limits, the focus was to create a single landing page for <a href="https://www.busplanner.com" target="_blank">busplanner.com</a>, which links to the existing pages. 
- No changes to the existing wording were made. The images were also sourced from the original page, and converted to SVG for this project.
- A good chunk of my time was spent on choosing the color that ensures a good contrast. I also referred to <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank">Adobe Color Wheel</a> when making this decision.
- Majority of my time was also spent on responsive design for various screen sizes. 
- Given more time, other features that could have been included are:
  - A responsive navbar for mobile view.
  - Inlude more components of the original website.
  - Possibly more refactoring in the Sass files.
- Other than that, a bit of time was dedicated to this README, and deployment of this project to a live link.

## Technology Stack 🔧
- <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a> (this project is built with <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank">Vite</a>)
- <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/" target="_blank">Sass</a> Styling
- <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/" target="_blank">MUI Library</a>

## Learnings 🧠
- Setting up react-vite deployment to Github pages.
- Adding a custom hook to show and hide sections based on their visibility in the viewport.
